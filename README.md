[Yarn]: https://yarnpkg.com/en/
[Babel]: https://babeljs.io/
[Webpack2]: https://webpack.js.org/

See [package.json](./package.json) for scripts and dependencies, including:

- [Photon](http://photonkit.com/)
- [Electron](http://electron.atom.io/)

Repository based on [electron-quick-start](https://github.com/electron/electron-quick-start).

## Usage

First, install [Yarn] for your system (you can replace `yarn` with `npm` below if you don't wish to switch yet)
- `yarn install` Install dependencies.
- `yarn watch` Compile development version and watch for changes. Bundled files will appear in `dist/`.
- `yarn start` Start the desktop app (while watcher is running in another terminal). Use Ctrl-R or Cmd-R to reload the app.
